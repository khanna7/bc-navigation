Breast Cancer R21: UIC-UChicago collaboration

# ABOUT
This is a collaboration between UIC and the Center for HIV Elimination (CCHE) at the University of Chicago. 

This research project uses an ABNM (agent based network model) to simulate the effects of patient navigation on breast cancer diagnosis in a population of Black American women in Chicago.

The model is calibrated using empirical data that is listed in ###cookbook?###. For parameters without empirical data, our content expert's best estimates are specified. 

The model is written in R. The slurm scheduler is used to submit jobs on the Midway2 cluster (rcc.uchicago.edu).

: I think it is self-explanatory. This gives people an idea about how the project is being maintained.
