Breast Cancer R21: UIC-UChicago collaboration

##ABOUT
This is a collaboration between UIC and the Center for HIV Elimination (CCHE) at the University of Chicago. 
This research project uses an ABNM (agent based network model) to simulate the effects of patient navigation on breast cancer diagnosis
in a population of Black American women in Chicago.
The model is calibrated using empirical data listed in ###cookbook?###, along with our content expert's best estimates where no data exists. 

The model is written in R, and slurm is used to manage the high performance computing using the Midway2 cluster (rcc.uchicago.edu).
