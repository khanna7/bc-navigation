# Installating the model

Installation of the model is simple. No compilation is required, as the model code is written entirely in R. As such, it should work across platforms if R is supported.

In order to obtain a copy, clone this reposity to your local machine with `git clone https://github.com/khanna7/bc-navigation`

If you are on UChicago's midway2 cluster, this should be enough to get you up and running using the existing submission scripts for SLURM jobs (principally `full_run.sh` and `burnin_gen.sh`)
