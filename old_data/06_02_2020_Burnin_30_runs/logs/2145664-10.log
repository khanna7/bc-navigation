NOTE: Versions before 3.6.1 had a bug in the implementation of the bd()
constriant which distorted the sampled distribution somewhat. In
addition, Sampson's Monks datasets had mislabeled vertices. See the
NEWS and the documentation for more details.

NOTE: Some common term arguments pertaining to vertex attribute and
level selection have changed in 3.10.0. See terms help for more
details. Use ‘options(ergm.term=list(version="3.9.4"))’ to use old
behavior.
